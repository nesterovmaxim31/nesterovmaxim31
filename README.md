## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Maksim, a C programmer deeply passionate about compilers, socket programming, embedded systems, Linux, and Verilog. I love diving into the details of network protocols, optimizing code for performance, and compiler design. My interests also span embedded development, Linux kernel, and crafting hardware solutions with Verilog. Always excited to collaborate on innovative projects and explore new challenges in systems programming and hardware design!
